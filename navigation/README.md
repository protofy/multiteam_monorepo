# monorepo setup: navigation module

The navigation team combines all provided widgets from feature A, B, and C, in mixed pages (e.g. mixed product stream) or 
an overall page to page navigation, where each feature team can provide standalone pages.

It can use its own tests, own libraries, own linting settings, and own way of presenting
their components in a showcase app (see `lib/main.dart`, which is not exported to other teams).
